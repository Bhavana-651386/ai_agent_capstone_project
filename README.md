__Project Overview__
The Smart CPG Decision Support Agent is an end-to-end AI-powered decision support system designed for Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) businesses.

It combines:

📂 Synthetic multi-store, multi-SKU sales data generation
📊 Analytical tools (trend detection, anomaly detection, scenario simulation)
🤖 GenAI reasoning using OpenAI (Azure-ready)
🧠 Agentic AI loop using LangChain
💻 Interactive CLI & Streamlit UI

The system automatically selects analytical tools based on business questions and generates executive-level strategy memos for business leaders.


__Problem Statement__
CPG companies operate across:
    - Multiple stores
    - Thousands of SKUs
    - Frequent promotional campaigns
    - Dynamic pricing changes

Traditional dashboards require manual analysis and do not provide decision-ready insights.
This project builds an Agentic AI Decision Support System that:
    - Ingests multi-store, multi-SKU sales data
    - Detects trends and anomalies
    - Simulates "what-if" business scenarios
    - Generates actionable strategy memos
    - Uses conversational memory for context-aware responses
